# final-assessment-deep-learning-nvidia-ai-institue
Final assessment for the course "Introduction to deep learning" by NVIDIA.

On this introductory course I've learned  valuable skills along the way and had a lot of fun doing it. In order to put those skills to the test I finnished the following assessment: I trained a model that is able to recognize fresh and rotten fruit. The model had a validation accuracy of `>98%`. I used some combination of transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine tuning.
